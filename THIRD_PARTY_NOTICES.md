# Third-Party Notices

This project is licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`).  
It depends on third-party open source packages that are licensed under their own terms.

This file is provided for convenience and does not replace the license texts of dependencies.
For an authoritative list, consult `package-lock.json` and the licenses shipped with each dependency.

## Notable third-party licenses in the dependency tree

- **ISC**
- **BSD-3-Clause**
- **BSD-2-Clause**
- **Apache-2.0**
- **CC-BY-4.0** (data/content)

### CC-BY-4.0

- `caniuse-lite` (used via tooling such as Browserslist) is licensed under **CC BY 4.0**.
  - You must provide attribution and indicate if changes were made when redistributing this content.

### Apache-2.0

Some dependencies are licensed under **Apache License 2.0**.

### Note on `exit@0.1.2`

`package-lock.json` does not include a `license` field for `exit@0.1.2` (a known npm lockfile quirk),
but the package is widely documented as **MIT** licensed.
